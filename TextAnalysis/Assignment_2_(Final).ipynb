In both cosine similarity and in word vecotrs, we found that the top 3 beers are still the same and thus we would reccomend the same product. However, if we were going by the top 5 beers, then the reccomendations would be different between the two. We also took a look at the percent of reviews given a product that mentioned a preferred attribute. As it turns out, the top 3 beers don't really have balanced or fruity. This is most likely because the reviews themselves don't use those words as seen in our word frequency analysis. However, we do get a good occurrence of light which was an attribute that we picked from our top word frequency analysis. To improve the other attributes, we think that changing fruity to citrus would be better overall since that word is used more to describe fruity beer."
